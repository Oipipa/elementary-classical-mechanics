<li>(Q1) A long straight trench, with rectangular cross section, has been dug in otherwise horizontal ground. The width of the trench is $d$ and its depth $2d$. A particle is projected at speed $v$, where $v^2 = \lambda dg$, at an angle $\alpha$ to the horizontal, from a point on the ground a distance $d$ from the nearer edge of the trench. The vertical plane in which it moves is perpendicular to the trench.<ul>
<li>The particle lands on the base of the trench without first touching either of its sides.<ul>
<li>By considering the vertical displacement of the particle when its horizontal displacement is $d$, show that $(\tan \alpha - \lambda)^2 &lt; \lambda^2 - 1$ and deduce that $\lambda &gt; 1$. </li>

<p>(Q2) A triangular prism lies on a horizontal plane. One of the rectangular faces of the prism is vertical; the second is horizontal and in contact with the plane; the third, oblique rectangular face makes an angle $\alpha$ with the horizontal. The two triangular faces of the prism are right angled triangles and are vertical. The prism has mass $M$ and it can move without friction across the plane. A particle of mass $m$ lies on the oblique surface of the prism. The contact between the particle and the plane is rough, with coefficient of friction $\mu$.</p>
<ul>
<li>Show that if $\mu &lt; \tan \alpha$, then the system cannot be in equilibrium.
Let $\mu = \tan \lambda$, with $0 &lt; \lambda &lt; \alpha &lt; \frac{1}{4}\pi$.

<p>(Q5) A rectangular prism is fixed on a horizontal surface. A vertical wall, parallel to a vertical face of the prism, stands at a distance $d$ from it. A light plank, making an acute angle $\theta$ with the horizontal, rests on an upper edge of the prism and is in contact with the wall below the level of that edge of the prism and above the level of the horizontal plane. You may assume that the plank is long enough and the prism high enough to make this possible. The contact between the plank and the prism is smooth, and the coefficient of friction at the contact between the plank and the wall is $\mu$.

$$
x^2 + \left( y + \frac{u^2 \tan \theta}{g} \right)^2 \leq \frac{u^4 \sec^2 \theta}{g^2}.
$$</li>
<li>Show that the furthest point directly up the plane that can be reached by a projectile from the cannon is a distance

<li>(Q7) Two particles, of masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ where $m_1 &gt; m_2$, are attached to the ends of a light, inextensible string. A particle of mass $M$ is fixed to a point $P$ on the string. The string passes over two small, smooth pulleys at $Q$ and $R$, where $QR$ is horizontal, so that the particle of mass $m_1$ hangs vertically below $Q$ and the particle of mass $m_2$ hangs vertically below $R$. The particle of mass $M$ hangs between the two pulleys with the section of the string $PQ$ making an acute angle of $\theta_1$ with the upward vertical and the section of the string $PR$ making an acute angle of $\theta_2$ with the upward vertical. $S$ is the point on $QR$ vertically above $P$.

<li>(Q8) A train moves westwards on a straight horizontal track with constant acceleration $a$, where $a &gt; 0$. Axes are chosen as follows: the origin is fixed in the train; the $x$-axis is in the direction of the track with the positive $x$-axis pointing to the East; and the positive $y$-axis points vertically upwards. A smooth wire is fixed in the train. It lies in the $x$-$y$ plane and is bent in the shape given by $ky = x^2$, where $k$ is a positive constant. A small bead is threaded onto the wire. Initially, the bead is held at the origin. It is then released.<ul>

<p>(Q13) Two small beads, $A$ and $B$, of the same mass, are threaded onto a vertical wire on which they slide without friction, and which is fixed to the ground at $P$. They are released simultaneously from rest, $A$ from a height of $8h$ above $P$ and $B$ from a height of $17h$ above $P$. When $A$ reaches the ground for the first time, it is moving with speed $V$. It then rebounds with coefficient of restitution $\tfrac{1}{2}$ and subsequently collides with $B$ at height $H$ above $P$. Show that $H = \dfrac{15}{8}h$ and find, in terms of $g$ and $h$, the speeds $u_A$ and $u_B$ of the two beads just before the collision.

<li>(Q14) A uniform elastic string lies on a smooth horizontal table. One end of the string is attached to a fixed peg, and the other end is pulled at constant speed $u$. At time $t = 0$, the string is taut and its length is $a$. Obtain an expression for the speed, at time $t$, of the point on the string which is a distance $x$ from the peg at time $t$. An ant walks along the string starting at $t = 0$ at the peg. The ant walks at constant speed $v$ along the string (so that its speed relative to the peg is the sum of $v$ and the speed of the point on the string beneath the ant). At time $t$, the ant is a distance $x$ from the peg. Write down a first order differential equation for $x$, and verify that
    $$
    \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{x}{a + ut} \right) = \frac{v}{a + ut}.
    $$
    Show that the time $T$ taken for the ant to reach the end of the string is given by
    $$
    uT = a \left( e^k - 1 \right),
    $$
    where $k = \frac{u}{v}$. On reaching the end of the string, the ant turns round and walks back to the peg. Find in terms of $T$ and $k$ the time taken for the journey back.</li>
<li>(Q15) The axles of the wheels of a motorbike of mass $m$ are a distance $b$ apart. Its centre of mass is a horizontal distance of $d$ from the front axle, where $d &lt; b$, and a vertical distance $h$ above the road, which is horizontal and straight. The engine is connected to the rear wheel. The coefficient of friction between the ground and the rear wheel is $\mu$, where $\mu &lt; b/h$, and the front wheel is smooth. You may assume that the sum of the moments of the forces acting on the motorbike about the centre of mass is zero. By taking moments about the centre of mass show that, as the acceleration of the motorbike increases from zero, the rear wheel will slip before the front wheel loses contact with the road if
    $$
    \mu &lt; \frac{b - d}{h}. \tag{<em>}

<p>Three pegs $P$, $Q$ and $R$ are fixed on a smooth horizontal table in such a way that they form the vertices of an equilateral triangle of side $2a$. A particle $X$ of mass $m$ lies on the table. It is attached to the pegs by three springs, $PX$, $QX$ and $RX$, each of modulus of elasticity $\lambda$ and natural length $l$, where $l &lt; \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}a$. Initially the particle is in equilibrium. Show that the extension in each spring is $\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}a - l$.</p>
<p>The particle is then pulled a small distance directly towards $P$ and released. Show that the tension $T$ in the spring $RX$ is given by
$$
T = \frac{\lambda}{l} \left( \sqrt{ \frac{4a^2}{3} + \frac{2ax}{\sqrt{3}} + x^2 } - l \right),

<p>A particle of mass $m$ is projected with velocity $\mathbf{u}$. It is acted upon by the force $mg$ due to gravity and by a resistive force $-mk\mathbf{v}$, where $\mathbf{v}$ is its velocity and $k$ is a positive constant.</p>

<p>A light rod of length $2a$ has a particle of mass $m$ attached to each end and it moves in a vertical plane. The midpoint of the rod has coordinates $(x, y)$, where the $x$-axis is horizontal (within the plane of motion) and $y$ is the height above a horizontal table. Initially, the rod is vertical, and at time $t$ later it is inclined at an angle $\theta$ to the vertical.</p>

<p>Let $I_1 &lt; I_2 &lt; I_3$ be the three principal moments of inertia of a rigid body that rotates freely with angular velocity $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ according to the Euler equations
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    I_1 \dot{\omega}_1 &amp;= (I_2 - I_3)\omega_2 \omega_3, \
    I_2 \dot{\omega}_2 &amp;= (I_3 - I_1)\omega_3 \omega_1, \
    I_3 \dot{\omega}_3 &amp;= (I_1 - I_2)\omega_1 \omega_2,
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    where the components $\omega_1$, $\omega_2$ and $\omega_3$ of the angular velocity are taken with respect to the principal axes of inertia.</p>
<p>(a) Write down expressions for the energy $E$ and the total angular momentum squared $L^2$, and prove that these are conserved using the Euler equations.</p>
<p>(b) Show that if $L^2 = 2E I_2$ there exist solutions in which the angular velocity is directed along the second principal axis, i.e., $\omega_1$ and $\omega_3$ are zero. What are the possible values for $\omega_2$? Use linearisation to analyse the stability of these solutions.</p>
<p>(c) Still working under the condition $L^2 = 2E I_2$, use your expressions from part (a) to express $\omega_1$ and $\omega_3$ in terms of $E$ and $L^2$, and hence obtain a first-order differential equation for $\omega_2$. Integrate this equation and show that $\omega_2(t) = \mu \tanh(\lambda t)$ for some constants $\mu$, $\lambda$ which you should find. Briefly comment on the relation of this solution to your answer to part (b).</p>
