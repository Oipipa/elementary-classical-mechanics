<li>(7.2) A flywheel of moment of inertia $I_0$ rotates with angular velocity $\omega_0$ at the middle of an axle of length $2l$. Each end of the axle is attached to a support by a spring which is stretched to length $l$ and provides tension $T$. You may assume that $T$ remains constant for small displacements of the axle. The supports are fixed to a table which rotates at constant angular velocity, $\Omega$, where $\Omega \ll \omega_0$. The center of mass of the flywheel is directly over the center of rotation of the table. Neglect gravity and assume that the motion is completely uniform so that nutational effects are absent. The problem is to find the direction of the axle with respect to a straight line between the supports.</li>

<li>(7.3) A gyroscope wheel is at one end of an axle of length $l$. The other end of the axle is suspended from a string of length $L$. The wheel is set into motion so that it executes uniform precession in the horizontal plane. The wheel has mass $M$ and moment of inertia about its center of mass $I_0$. Its spin angular velocity is $\omega_s$. Neglect the mass of the shaft and of the string. Find the angle $\beta$ that the string makes with the vertical. Assume that $\beta$ is so small that approximations like $\sin \beta \approx \beta$ are justified.</li>

<li>(7.4) In an old-fashioned rolling mill, grain is ground by a disk-shaped millstone which rolls in a circle on a flat surface driven by a vertical shaft. Because of the stone's angular momentum, the contact force with the surface can be considerably greater than the weight of the wheel. Assume that the millstone is a uniform disk of mass $M$, radius $b$, and width $w$, and that it rolls without slipping in a circle of radius $R$ with angular velocity $\Omega$. Find the contact force. Assume that the millstone is closely fitted to the axle so that it cannot tip, and that $w \ll R$. Neglect friction.</li>

<li>(7.5) When an automobile rounds a curve at high speed, the loading (weight distribution) on the wheels is markedly changed. For sufficiently high speeds the loading on the inside wheels goes to zero, at which point the car starts to roll over. This tendency can be avoided by mounting a large spinning flywheel on the car.<ul>
<li>In what direction should the flywheel be mounted, and what should be the sense of rotation, to help equalize the loading? (Be sure that your method works for the car turning in either direction.)</li>
<li>Show that for a disk-shaped flywheel of mass $m$ and radius $R$, the requirement for equal loading is that the angular velocity of the flywheel, $\omega$, is related to the velocity of the car $v$ by
$$
\omega = 2v \frac{ML}{mR^2},
$$
where $M$ is the total mass of the car and flywheel, and $L$ is the height of the center of mass of the car (including the flywheel) above the road. Assume that the road is unbanked.</li>

<li>(7.6) If you start a coin rolling on a table with care, you can make it roll in a circle. The coin "leans" inward, with its axis tilted. The radius of the coin is $b$, the radius of the circle it follows on the table is $R$, and its velocity is $v$. Assume that there is no slipping. Find the angle $\phi$ that the axis makes with the horizontal.</li>

<li>(7.7) A thin hoop of mass $M$ and radius $R$ is suspended from a string through a point on the rim of the hoop. If the support is turned with high angular velocity $\omega$, the hoop will spin as shown, with its plane nearly horizontal and its center nearly on the axis of the support. The string makes angle $\alpha$ with the vertical.<ul>
<li>Find, approximately, the small angle $\beta$ between the plane of the hoop and the horizontal.</li>
<li>Find, approximately, the radius of the small circle traced out by the center of mass about the vertical axis. (With skill you can demonstrate this motion with a rope. It is a favorite cowboy lariat trick.)</li>

<li>(7.8) A child's hoop of mass $M$ and radius $b$ rolls in a straight line with velocity $v$. Its top is given a light tap with a stick at right angles to the direction of motion. The impulse of the blow is $I$.<ul>
<li>Show that this results in a deflection of the line of rolling by angle $\phi = I / Mv$, assuming that the gyroscope approximation holds and neglecting friction with the ground.</li>
<li>Show that the gyroscope approximation is valid provided $F \ll Mv^2 / b$, where $F$ is the peak applied force.</li>

<li>(7.9) This problem involves investigating the effect of the angular momentum of a bicycle’s wheels on the stability of the bicycle and rider. Assume that the center of mass of the bike and rider is height $2l$ above the ground. Each wheel has mass $m$, radius $l$, and moment of inertia $ml^2$. The bicycle moves with velocity $V$ in a circular path of radius $R$. Show that it leans through an angle given by
$$
\tan \phi = \frac{V^2}{Rg} \left( 1 + \frac{m}{M} \right),
$$
    where $M$ is the total mass. The last term in parentheses would be absent if angular momentum were neglected. Do you think that it is important? How important is it for a bike without a rider?</li>

<li>(7.10) Latitude can be measured with a gyro by mounting the gyro with its axle horizontal and lying along the east-west axis.<ul>
<li>Show that the gyro can remain stationary when its spin axis is parallel to the polar axis and is at the latitude angle $\lambda$ with the horizontal. </li>
<li>If the gyro is released with the spin axis at a small angle to the polar axis show that the gyro spin axis will oscillate about the polar axis with a frequency </li>

<p>$$
\omega_{\text{osc}} = \sqrt{I_1 \omega_s \Omega_e / I_\perp},
$$</p>
<p>where $I_1$ is the moment of inertia of the gyro about its spin axis, $I_\perp$ is its moment of inertia about the fixed horizontal axis, and $\Omega_e$ is the earth's rotational angular velocity.</p>
<p>What value of $\omega_{\text{osc}}$ is expected for a gyro rotating at 40{,}000 rpm, assuming that it is a thin disk and that the mounting frame makes no contribution to the moment of inertia?</p>
